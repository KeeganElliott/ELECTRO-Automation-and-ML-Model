# ELECTRO Automation & Assistive/Predictive Machine Learning Platform

An integrated automation platform for high-voltage bushing design, simulation, digital signal processing (DSP), feature extraction, and assistive/predictive machine learning using Integrated Engineering Software's **ELECTRO**.

The project automates much of the engineering workflow required to analyze high-voltage bushings, collect geometric and simulation data, generate machine-learning-ready datasets, and develop predictive models capable of evaluating future bushing designs.
